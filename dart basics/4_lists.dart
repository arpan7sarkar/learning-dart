//list is similer to  array or i would say python ke chiz😂+ js ke jesa mixeddatatype support
void main() {
  var myList=["hello",5,5.8,true,0,null,"33",0,"done"];
  var yourList=["ok","here",55,0.1,22,4,false];
  print(myList[1]);
  print(myList.sublist(3,8));//it also has sublist similer to java
  //lets join two lists
  print(myList+yourList);//OMG its that easy☠️
  print(myList.sublist(0,3)+yourList.sublist(3,5));//to much amazing

  //it also copied spread operator from js
  print([4,2,5,...myList]);//🌪️🌪️

  //one corn is can't use negative indexing
  // print(myList[-1]); wrong syntax🥲

  
}
//dart===mix of many programing languages in a single pack ithink 🤓😂
